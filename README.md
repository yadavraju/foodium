# Foodium 🍲 


## About
It simply loads **Posts** data from API and stores it in persistence storage (i.e. SQLite Database). Posts will be always loaded from local database. Remote data (from API) and Local data is always synchronized. 
- This makes it offline capable 😃. 
- Clean and Simple Material UI.
- It supports dark theme too 🌗.

*Dummy API is used in this app. JSON response is statically hosted [here](https://patilshreyas.github.io/DummyFoodiumApi/api/posts/)*.
